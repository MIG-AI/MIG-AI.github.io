                                Sample efficiency has been one of the major challenges for deep reinforcement learning. 
								Recently, model-based reinforcement learning has been proposed to address this challenge by performing planning on imaginary trajectories with a learned world model. 
								However, world model learning may suffer from overfitting to training trajectories, and thus model-based value estimation and policy search will be prone to be sucked in an inferior local policy. 
								In this paper, we propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, called BrIdging Reality and Dream (BIRD). 
								It maximizes the mutual information between imaginary and real trajectories so that the policy improvement learned from imaginary trajectories can be easily generalized to real trajectories. 
								We demonstrate that our approach improves sample efficiency of model-based planning, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual control benchmarks.

                                ROMA learns sub-task specialization in cooperative agent teams by proposing a role-oriented learning framework. 
                                In this framework, roles are emergent, and agents with similar roles tend to share their learning to be specialized on certain 
                                sub-tasks. ROMA can learn specialized, dynamic, versatile, and identifiable roles, and push forward the state of the art on the 
                                StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.

                                This paper presents a novel self-supervised object-oriented framework to enable efficient object-based dynamics 
                                learning and planning, which employs a three-level learning architecture from motion detection, to dynamic instance
                                 segmentation, and to dynamics learning. This framework can learn model from few interactions with environments and 
                                 enable an agent to directly plan in unseen environments without retraining. In addition, it learns semantically and 
                                 visually interpretable representations.

                                This paper aims to adapt low-level skills to downstream tasks while maintaining the generality of reward design. Siyuan Li and Rui Wang proposed an HRL framework which 
                                sets auxiliary rewards for low-level skill training based on the advantage function of the high-level policy. This auxiliary reward enables efficient, simultaneous 
                                learning of the high-level policy and low-level skills without using task-specific knowledge. In addition, they also theoretically prove that optimizing low-level 
                                skills with this auxiliary reward will increase the task return for the joint policy.
